# Breast Radar-based Image Quality Analysis (BRIQS) Framework
BRIQS provides an open-source reconstruction software through MERIT (https://github.com/EMFMed/MERIT) with the BRIGID phantom dataset for Microwave Radar-based Image Quality Analysis. BRIQS contains functions for configuring image regions and assessing these through a number of metrics. 

# Using BRIQS 
An example of using BRIQS to image a phantom in 3D and obtain metric scores is available in getting_started.m
